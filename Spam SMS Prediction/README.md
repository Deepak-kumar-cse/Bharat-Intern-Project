# SPAM SMS Prediction :notebook:
In this repo i have created a SMS Spam Prediction project in machine learning using NLP, and i am using [nltk](https://pypi.org/project/nltk/) Library for NLP.



# Motivation :monocle_face:
  - Day by day people get a lot of sms, In those sms include are spam and helpful message. In today's runaway life we don't have enough time to recognize these sms whether it is spam or not, so i have develop a machine learning programme using kaggle dataset which will split the sms. Hope this programme are helpful for you.
