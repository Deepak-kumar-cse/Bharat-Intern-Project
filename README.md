# 1.Titanic Classification Project 
## Overview
This project is a classification task based on the famous Titanic dataset. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, sex, passenger class, etc.

# Features

    Survived: 1 if the passenger survived, 0 otherwise (target variable)
    Pclass: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)
    Name: Passenger's name
    Sex: Passenger's sex (male or female)
    Age: Passenger's age
    SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
    Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
    Ticket: Ticket number
    Fare: Fare paid for the ticket
    Cabin: Cabin number
    Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

# 2.Spam SMS Prediction 
This project is aimed at predicting whether a given SMS message is spam or not. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze the text data and classify messages accordingly.

# Motivation :monocle_face:
  - Day by day people get a lot of sms, In those sms include are spam and helpful message. In today's runaway life we don't have enough time to recognize these sms whether it is spam or not, so i have develop a machine learning programme using kaggle dataset which will split the sms. Hope this programme are helpful for you. 

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for exploring data and training the model interactively)
